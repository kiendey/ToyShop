# ToyShop

ToyShop is a simple web application built using Spring Boot and Bootstrap. Spring Boot powers the backend, providing a robust framework for creating a RESTful API and managing business logic, while Bootstrap enhances the frontend with a responsive, modern UI design. This project demonstrates how to integrate a Java-based backend with a stylish, user-friendly interface, ideal for showcasing an online toy store with features like product listings, user authentication, and a shopping cart.
